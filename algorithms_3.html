Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, â€¦

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed two million, find the sum of the even-valued terms. (hint: if (a % 2 == 0) { ... }) */

// I "borrowed" the first for loop from the following url via stackoverflow.com: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7944239/generating-fibonacci-sequence. I didn't understand how to construct the loop. After copying this loop, however, I wrote out each fib[i] loop on paper until I figured out how the computer was coming up with those numbers. //

var fib = []; // Initialize array!
var nums = [];
var sum = 0;

fib[0] = 0;
fib[1] = 1;

//For loop #1
  for(var i=2; i<100; i++) {
    // Next fibonacci number = previous + one before previous
    fib[i] = fib[i-2] + fib[i-1];
    // console.log(fib[i]);
      
}
//For loop #2
// This next for loop takes the array produced by for loop #1 and determines whether it is divisible by 2. For those that satisfy the condition, I am pushing those integers to the nums array.  
  for(var i = 0; i<fib.length; i++) {
    if (fib[i] % 2 == 0) {
        nums.push(fib[i]); 
    }
  }
//For loop #3
//This for loop takes the nums array and adds every integer inside of it
  for (var i=0; i < nums.length; i++) {
      sum = sum + nums[i];

  }
      console.log(sum);
      // console.log(nums);
